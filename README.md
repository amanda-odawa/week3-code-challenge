# Week 3 Code Challenge

## Movie Ticket Booking Application

### Overview

This project is a simple web application that allows users to view movies and purchase tickets. It fetches movie details from a REST API and allows users to select a movie, view its details, and buy tickets. If a movie is sold out, the interface reflects that by changing the button text to "Sold Out" and applying a `sold-out` class to the corresponding movie item.
